Hi Mr. Qureshi. This 'Digital Garden' is a loose online copy of my(Elijah's) obsidian notes, which you can navigate through the contents sidebar or links. Clicking on any purple or bracketed link will take you to a linked note on the subject (Some are more detailed than others). You might want to start with [[Industrial revolution/Countries/Britain\|Britain]]. The node graph on the right shows all of the connects. You can switch the slider on top to 3 or press the globe button to see all of my note connections, and you can click on any node to go to that note. They're also really fun to drag around in the console.
